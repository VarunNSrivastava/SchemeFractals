# SchemeFractals
Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, has no built in graphics engine. Using several basic Turtle commands, this project seeks to generate intricate and artistic fractals in under 512 Scheme Tokens. For reference, a parenthesis, string value, apostrophe, and several other values are all treated as a single token.
