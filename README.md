# SchemeFractals
Scheme, a dialect of Lisp, has no built in graphics engine. Using several basic Turtle commands, this project seeks to generate intricate and artistic fractals in under 512 Scheme Tokens. For reference, a parenthesis, string value, apostrophe, and several other values are all treated as a single token. 

The current code generates the following image in roughly 45 minutes of rendering time:

The code can be easily modified to create slightly different fractals, such as the following:

The interpreter for Scheme was created in Python as part of a project for the class CS61a at UC Berkeley. The code for the Turtle commands was provided by the class. The documentation within the code provides some structure as to how to create different fractals.
